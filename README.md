# Web Library
## This is a node web app that I made to be able to store all my web saves locally. 
## Usage
- Firstly, I add the webpages I want to save from any website, to my Pocket saves, form any device like my phone or laptop.
- Then, whenever I run this app, it fetches all those saves from Pocket and stores them locally, removing them from Pocket.
- After this, I can do whatever I want with the saves which I have stored in a JSON file in a simple { link: title } format.
- Currently, I am just displaying them, but hypothetically I could make them searchable, and analyse them and so on.
