# Web Library
### Minimal node web app that I made to be able to store all my web saves locally. 
![alt text](project_assets/image.png)

## Basic working of this Prototype:
- Firstly, I add the webpages I want to save from any website, to my Pocket saves, from any device like my phone or laptop.
- Then, whenever I run this app, it fetches all those saves from Pocket and stores them locally, removing them from Pocket.
- After this, I can do whatever I want with the saves which I have stored in a JSON file in a simple { "link": "title" } format.
- Currently, I am just displaying them, but hypothetically I could make them searchable, and analyse them and so on.

## How to use?

Unfortunately as pocket has been shut down, this app is useless now. I have shifted to raindrop for managing my bookmarks. It already has some great inbuilt features that make this kind of app redundant. So it goes!
