# Web Library
### Minimal node web app that I made to be able to store all my web saves locally. 
![alt text](project_assets/image.png)

## Basic working of this Prototype:
- ### Firstly, I add the webpages I want to save from any website, to my Pocket saves, from any device like my phone or laptop.
- ### Then, whenever I run this app, it fetches all those saves from Pocket and stores them locally, removing them from Pocket.
- ### After this, I can do whatever I want with the saves which I have stored in a JSON file in a simple { "link": "title" } format.
- ### Currently, I am just displaying them, but hypothetically I could make them searchable, and analyse them and so on.

## How to use?
- ### Just fork and clone the whole project onto your local system.
- ### Go to the base directory of the project, to run it with Node JS.
- ### To connect with pocket one needs a "platform consumer key." ([See Here!](https://getpocket.com/developer/docs/authentication))
- ### After authenticating with it successfully, the Web Library is fully functional.
